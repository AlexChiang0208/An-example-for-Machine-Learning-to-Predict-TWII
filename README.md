# An-example-for-Machine-Learning-to-Predict-TWII
This is a simple example for machine learning to predict TWII future price step by step. Because it’s my note when I just learn for half year in university, if you find any question or you have some suggestion, please feel free to tell me. 


#### Objective:
> Using listed stock and TWII close price on t, t-1, … , t-4 making features, to predict TWII close price on t+5.
